## Project Description

**Disclosure:** None of the files in this repo are original. These are all projects that were provided by *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow*, an exceptional book on machine learning that was written by Aurelien Geron and published by O'Reilly. This repo acts as a place I can store these guided projects and refer back to them down the line as I begin my own machine learning projects.

The order in which I completed these projects are as follows:

1. Housing.ipynb
