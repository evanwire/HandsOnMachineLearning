## Project Description

**Disclosure:** None of the files in this repo are original. These are all projects that were provided by *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow*, an exceptional book on machine learning that was written by Aurelien Geron and published by O'Reilly. This repo acts as a place I can store these guided projects and refer back to them down the line as I begin my own machine learning projects.

For each chapter in the book, the chapter title and the code for each chapter is as follows:

Chapter 1. The Fundamentals of Machine Learning  -  No code in this chapter<br>
Chapter 2. End-to-End Machine Learning Project  -  Housing.ipynb<br>
Chapter 3. Classification  -  Classification.ipynb<br>
Chapter 4. Training Models  -  Training_Linear_Models.ipynb<br>
Chapter 5. Support Vector Machines - Support_Vector_Machines.ipynb<br>
Chapter 6. Decision Trees - Decision_Trees.ipynb<br>
